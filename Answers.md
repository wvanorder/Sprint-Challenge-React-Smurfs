1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

- Client-side routing is when everything is loaded to the client at once, and the changing of urls is actually just a manipulation of the url where all the corresponding data is loading on the same.html page. Server side routing is when a link takes you to an entirely different page, which requires a request be made back to the server to update with the new .html page.
